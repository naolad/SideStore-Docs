# Make a Source

SideStore is fully compatible with AltSources. The official AltStore [source documentation](https://faq.altstore.io/developers/make-a-source) provides all the details you need to make your own AltSource. AltSources allow your audience to view, install, and update all your available apps easily across both AltStore and SideStore.

When editing your source, it is highly recommended to create and view a draft of your changes using the [AltSource Browser](https://altsource.by.lao.sb/browse) to see a visual display of your source and correct any errors before finalizing and publishing changes to your source.

# Distributing your Source

You can create a link to automatically add your AltSource by using this template: 
```
sidestore://source?url=[source url]
```
For more info, see [URL Schema](/docs/advanced/url-schema). It is often helpful to create the link to your AltSource in this format, then put it into a link shortener such as ```tinyurl.com```. However, if a user tries to use a sidestore:// link without SideStore already installed, it will crash, so some documentation may be helpful.

## That's it!

Here are some good existing AltSources: The [official AltStore](https://apps.altstore.io) source, the [SideStore community](https://github.com/SideStore/Community-Source) source, the [StikJIT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT/refs/heads/main/repo.json) source, and the [DolphiniOS](https://altstore.oatmealdome.me) source.
