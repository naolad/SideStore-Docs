title: Enabling JIT
description: A tutorial on how to enable Just-in-Time (JIT) Compilation for apps that require it.
---

:::note

There are many methods to enabling JIT, such as AltJIT, SideJITServer, and more. This tutorial will cover the use of StikJIT/StikDebug, as it is the method we currently recommend. As an alternative, SideStore 0.6.2-nightly.2025.04.15 also includes updates to minimuxer, allowing built-in JIT functionality similar to StikDebug. To use this, simply ensure you are connected to StosVPN and Wi-Fi or with mobile data and Wi-Fi disabled.
:::

## Prerequisites
* An iDevice on iOS/iPadOS 17.4 or above, excluding 18.4b1. If you are on 17.0-17.3, you must use an alternative such as [SideJITServer](https://github.com/nythepegasus/SideJITServer)
* At least 1 free app slot for StikJIT

## StikJIT installation with SideStore
   
1. **Obtain StikJIT:**  
   Add the StikJIT AltSource to SideStore [here](sidestore://source?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StephenDev0/StikJIT/refs/heads/main/repo.json) (You must have SideStore installed or this link will not function).

2. **Install:**
   Use SideStore to install StikJIT.

3. **Installation procedures:**
   Follow the standard installation procedures in the usage guide below.

## StikDebug installation with App Store (Doesn't require an app slot)

1. **Install StikDebug**
   Install StikDebug from the App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stikdebug/id6744045754). Something nice- the VPN present in StikDebug is similar to the one used in SideStore, meaning you use it to install and refresh apps as well.

2. **Installation procedures:**
   Follow the standard installation procedures in the usage guide below.

### Standard installation procedures:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by activating StosVPN for StikJIT or the built-in VPN in StikDebug.

2. **Upload the Pairing File:**  
   When prompted, import the same **unzipped pairing file** obtained via JitterbugPair you use for SideStore. For more information on obtaining this pairing file, see [here](/docs/installation/pairing-file).

## To enable JIT:

1. **Enable VPN:**  
   Start by activating StosVPN for StikJIT or the built-in VPN in StikDebug.
   
2. **Activate JIT:**  
   Click the “Enable JIT” button and select an app from the list to activate the JIT functionality.

### Offline JIT Enabling
To enable JIT offline, enable the StosVPN VPN or StikDebug. Then, turn both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data OFF when you launch StikJIT (use Airplane Mode). You can then enable JIT as normal.
