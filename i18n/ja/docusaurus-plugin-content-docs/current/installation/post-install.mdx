The last step to installing SideStore is to refresh SideStore, within itself.

To do this, you need to:

1. Connect to StosVPN.
2. Open SideStore.
3. If you haven't already, select the pairing file.
4. Go to "My Apps".
5. Select the "x DAYS" button, where x is the number of days until expire.
    * If successful, this will open a blank Safari tab or go to your home screen. You will get a notification also telling you to do this.

If SideStore is not refreshed, a bug causing early expiry will require you to reinstall SideStore. There is a plan to have this done automatically, but for now it needs to be done manually.
