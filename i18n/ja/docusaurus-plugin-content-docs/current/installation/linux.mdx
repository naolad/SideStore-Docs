To install SideStore (or any other IPA) on Linux, make sure you have Docker installed. Before you start, make sure to install StosVPN and any other and [prerequisites](prerequisites) that are satisfied!

1. Run altcon with Docker
```bash
docker run --rm -it -e ALTSERVER_ANISETTE_SERVER="https://ani.sidestore.io/" -v ${PWD}/:/mnt/ -v /var/run:/var/run ghcr.io/sidestore/altcon
```

You can also run altcon with Podman
```bash
podman run --privileged --rm -it -e ALTSERVER_ANISETTE_SERVER="https://ani.sidestore.io/" -v ${PWD}/:/mnt/ -v /var/run:/var/run ghcr.io/sidestore/altcon
```

Altcon will start to pair with your device, plug it in if you haven't. Press "trust" and enter your passcode.

When you finish, then follow the [post-install instructions](post-install).
